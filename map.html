	<div class="map1">
		<img src="../images/ascent.jpeg" width="380px" height="400px">
		<h6>An open playground for small wars of position and attrition divide two sites on Ascent. Each site can be fortified by irreversible bomb doors; once they’re down, you’ll have to destroy them or find another way. Yield as little territory as possible. Ascent was the first new map to be added since Valorant’s official release. It’s a two site map that is located in Venice, Italy. Compared to the other maps, Ascent has the most open area with a large courtyard at the center of the map. The courtyard offers a quick short cut to the sides of the map but is risky to cross since it doesn’t contain that much cover. Another signature feature that is unique to Ascent is its closeable doors. At each defensive site, there is a door that can be open or closed using a switch. The door is armored but can be broken.</h6>

	<div class="map2">
		<img src="../images/bind.png" width="380px" height="400px">
		<h6>Bind is a two site map (A and B) that has attackers infiltrating from a beach coast. Site A is accessible through an alleyway in the middle of the map called “short A” or through a building’s hallway called, “showers”. Site B is accessible by a path along the beach called “long B” or through a marketplace and window called “hookah”. A unique aspect of this map is that there are two one-way teleporters. One teleporter takes you from long B to the attacker’s side of showers. The other takes you from short A to the attacker’s side of hookah. These allow both attackers and defenders alike to quickly rotate or flank the opposing team. The teleporter is incredibly noisy so it is somewhat risky to do so if your enemies are expecting it. You can also throw projectiles, drones, and guns through teleporters. One ultimate orb can be found inside the showers while the other is at long B right in front of the teleporter.</h6>

	<div class="map3">
		<img src="../images/haven.png" width="380px" height="400px">
		<h6>Haven is a three site map (A, B, C), which is also its unique aspect as most bomb/defusal maps in FPS games tend to be two sites. Site A is accessible through an L-shaped’ alleyway called “long A” or through an underground passage called “sewers” (A-short). As expected, long A is more suited for long-ranged engagements while the sewers will bring close quarter combat. Site B is accessible through a window which leads into an outdoor courtyard. The courtyard also leads to a set of doors called “garage” which allows attackers to wrap around to Site B. The garage also acts as a connector to Site C, so attackers that make it through can threaten both B and C. The other entry point to Site C is through a straight alleyway called “long C”. Long C has a cubby partway through so attackers can use smokes to advance safely. The two ultimate orbs can be found at Site A outside of long A or at Site C outside of long C.</h6>
	</div>
	<div class="map4">
		<img src="../images/split.png" width="380px" height="400px">
		<h6>Split was added as of the first day of closed beta. Its two sites are on the far left and right sides of the map with a middle area that provides high ground dominance. The unique mechanic here is that there are ropes that allow players to quickly ascend or descend quietly – you can find them at A Sewer, B Rafters, and Mid Vent. The ultimate orbs can be found at at A main and within B main, also known as the garage. This map is a short map and players can quickly get over from one place to another. There are various places where players can take an edge on others. As the map is small, some teams usually stack(pile up at one site) and then when the spike is planted on the other they play retake i.e each player reaches the site from all the enteries and rush together to conqueor it. </h6>
	</div>
	<div class="map5">
		<img src="../images/icebox.jpeg" width="380px" height="400px">
		<h6>Your next battleground is a secret Kingdom excavation site overtaken by the arctic. The two plant sites protected by snow and metal require some horizontal finesse. Take advantage of the ziplines and they’ll never see you. Icebox is the first map to introduce horizontal ziplines, seen at the A Site. Each Icebox site is a complex combat space that features plenty of cover and verticality. This map emphasizes skirmishes, sharp aim, and adaptive play. It is also the first map where the plant site has different levels of elevation. Both sites contain nests that players can get into using ropes and then plant the spike on the nest floor.</h6>
